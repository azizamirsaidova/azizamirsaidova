### Hi there 👋 I’m Aziza


**azizamirsaidova/azizamirsaidova** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
- 🔭 I’m currently pursuing Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern University.
- 🌱 I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence, in particular, understanding the natural languaga and processing it to develop human like intelligent systems.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on research in Nlp and Nlu.
- 📫 How to reach me: azizakhon@u.northwestern.edu or via LinkedIn.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Outside of academics and tech, I practice fencing, learn foreign languages (currently: Arabic) and read books about behavioral economics and history of science and technology.
