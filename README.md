### Hi thereðŸ‘‹ 
 
I'm Aziza, researcher and engineer interested in topics related to data science, ml and nlp. I'm a recent Master's graduate from Artificial Intelligence program at Northwestern University and currently work in [Blinc](https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/projects/blinc/) platfom at [Tiilt Lab](https://tiilt.northwestern.edu) enhancing its speech and nlp capability. 

These days, I'm exploring/working/experimenting with, 
- question answering, information retrieval methods,
- multilingual(particularly Turkic langs) datasets and its application to various NLP tasks.

I'm also looking for a ml/nlp engineer roles where I can get involved in interesting and impact driven projects. So, if you are hiring, visit my [page](https://azizamirsaidova.github.io) for more info on my past projects.
