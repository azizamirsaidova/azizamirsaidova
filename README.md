### Hi thereðŸ‘‹ 
 
I'm Aziza, a Master's student studying Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern University. I'm a Machine Learning Engineer Intern Co-op with Adobe. I'm also involved in Mim project with C2 Lab working on Answer Type Prediction for Question Answering Systems. In addition, I'm involved as a Research Assistant in Blinc project with Tiilt Lab working with Speech & Natural Language Processing techniques.

This summer, I did a Data Science Internship with University of Washington's eScience Institute and created relational database system using Python and SQLAlchemy. For more information, visit project's [GitHub page](https://lnkd.in/gGPDA6sa), [project's website](https://lnkd.in/g5wNRmRY) and [project's highlights in the news](https://lnkd.in/gKunGhyS).
